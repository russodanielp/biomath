## PCSK9

[Wikipedia page for PCSK9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCSK9).

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9).

PCSK9 -> binds to Low-Density Lipid Receptor (LDLR), which binds to LDL in
extracellular fluid and and ingests them into cells.

Plasma PCSK9 binds the LDLR on the surface of hepatic and peripheral cells.
The PCSK9-LDLR complex is internalized into the cell leaving less LDLR to bind
to LDL, and thus creating an increase in LDL in the plasma. Thus, inhibition of
PCSK9 results in increased levels of LDLR on cell surface, capable of internalizing
LDL.

## Statins

[Wikipedia page for Statins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statins)

Statins, also known as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, are a class of
lipid-lowering medications. Many people with high cholesterol take statins,
which have been show to elevate levels of PCSK9.

## From Ruths slides

First goal: Develop model parameterizations for statin responders and
non-responders and determine whether the statin-responders have a better
outcome on PCSK9 therapy than statin-non-responders.
